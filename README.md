# Machine Learning Basics Course Repository

This repository contains Python code for assignments from the "Machine Learning Basics" university course. The purpose of this repository is to document the code used in the course assignments.

## Course Overview

The "Machine Learning basics" course covers the following topics:
- Data preparation steps for machine learning
- Basic concepts of machine learning algorithms
- Implementation of machine learning algorithms from scratch

## Assignments Overview

**Assignment 1: kNN Algorithm (Library Implementation)**
   - This assignment covers the use of the kNN (k-Nearest Neighbors) algorithm from a library.

**Assignment 2: kNN Algorithm (Manual Implementation)**
   - This assignment involves the manual implementation of the kNN algorithm.

**Assignment 3: Data Preparation**
   - This assignment focuses on data preparation of a provided dataset, which was intentionally adapted.

**Assignment 4: Decision Tree Model (Manual Implementation)**
   - This assignment requires the manual implementation of a decision tree model.

## Code Contents

The repository contains Python code for each assignment. Each assignment is organized into its own directory.
